# 🤟 American Sign Language (ASL) Hand Gesture Recognition

This project is a deep learning-based system designed to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures for both alphabets (A–Z) and numbers (0–9). It includes data preprocessing, background removal, model training using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and evaluation.

## 🧠 Model Pipeline

### 🔧 Preprocessing
- Manual background removal using pixel-based segmentation
- Resizing & grayscale conversion
- Normalization to [0, 1]
- Balanced dataset across classes
- Train/test split

### 🔁 Postprocessing
- Decoded model predictions into corresponding gesture labels
- Evaluation with:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - F1-Score
